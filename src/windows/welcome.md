## Additional Configuration

You can customize iamb in your `$CONFIG_DIR/iamb/config.toml` file, where
`$CONFIG_DIR` is your system's per-user configuration directory. For example,
this is typically `~/.config/iamb/config.toml` on systems that use the XDG
Base Directory Specification.

See the manual pages or <https://iamb.chat> for more details on how to
further configure or use iamb.
